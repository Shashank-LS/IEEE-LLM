Question,LLM Response,Verification
Please describe the read feature in detail.,"The read feature involves transferring data from a storage device to the host system. It typically consists of three stages:

1. **Request**: The host system sends a read request to the storage device, specifying the sector(s) or block(s) it wants to read.
2. **Data transfer**: The storage device reads the requested data from its memory and transmits it back to the host system through a communication channel (e.g., SATA, PCIe).
3. **Completion**: The Completer (usually the storage device) sends an end-of-transfer signal to the Initiator (the host system), indicating that all requested data has been transferred.

In this process, the Completer must provide the data before the end of the read transfer, ensuring that no data is left out or corrupted during the transfer.",
What signals need to be driven and in what sequence to initiate the read operation?,"The sequence for initiating a read operation involves driving the following signals:

1. Send a read request (request signal)
2. Drive PSEL low, then high after the request
3. Drive PENABLE high 
4. Data transfer will begin after these steps are completed",
How should the slave signals respond to the master signals during the read operation?,"During a read operation, the slave signals should respond as follows:

1. The slave should drive PDIR (Data In) with valid data when PVALID is high.
2. When PADDR is stable and PVALID is low, it indicates the end of data transfer.
3. After the data transfer ends, the slave can drive PDIR to an undefined state.",
"After driving the master signals, what response should be expected from the slave signals, based on their timing and functional attributes?","1. The slave should drive PDIR (Data In) with valid data when PVALID is high.
2. After PVALID goes low, the slave can stop driving PDIR as it's no longer required.
3. When PADDR becomes stable, it indicates the end of data transfer, and the slave can then drive PDIR to an undefined state.",
